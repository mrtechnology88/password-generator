****** Random Password Generator By Moe Hodroj ******
I created three files :
- index.html --> Main Page HTML File
- main.js --> Main Javascript File
- style.css --> Main CSS File
In index.html we used bootstrap 4 to make the website responsive on different devices. We used semantic HTML to follow the latest industry standards.
Also i included comments in every file, to explain how the code is running in html,js, and css. I did my research to get an idea how does a password generator runs. I used stackoverflow, w3schools, MDN mozilla, youtube tutorials, and codepen websites to acheive this result.
I worked first on the html part, then moved to javascript and finally took my time to style my page. In my opinion from a user perspective you might have a strong code foundation. But if the UI is not friendly user and easy to use and clear. The user won't spend his time to use your app. There is a lot of other alternatives. Resources are included in each file that i used to build this app.
